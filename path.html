                        <p>As a soldier, I gained valuable skills such as leadership, teamwork, and discipline, which I believe are all essential qualities for a successful career in management. As a paratrooper, I was trained to take calculated risks and make quick decisions in high-pressure situations, which I also believe are crucial skills in the business world. Additionally, I gained experience in managing people and resources, as well as working under tight deadlines and limited resources, which I feel are all transferable to a corporate finance role.</p>

                        <p>My BS in Mechanical Engineering also provided me with valuable technical skills that are in high demand in the business world. As a process engineer for the Naval Nuclear Laboratory, I gained experience in project management, quality control, and process improvement, which I believe are all valuable skills in a corporate finance role. Additionally, my technical background may make me particularly suited for roles in finance that involve analysis of technical data or products.</p>
                            
                        <p>By pursuing an MBA, I have shown my commitment to developing my business acumen and expanding my skill set beyond technical expertise. I believe that an MBA is a valuable credential in the business world, and it demonstrates to potential employers that I have a solid understanding of finance, marketing, management, and other key business functions. Through my MBA program, I gained exposure to financial modeling, accounting, and other key financial concepts, which I believe are essential for a career in corporate finance.</p>
                            
                        <p>Overall, I believe that my combination of military service, BS in engineering, and MBA make me a strong candidate for a role in management within a corporate finance role. My foundation of personal responsibility, technical skill, and strong work ethic, along with my business acumen and financial knowledge, will serve me well in my future career endeavors.</p>       

                        <p>I currently work as a senior financial analyst at Melaleuca: The Wellness Company. My current career path is to succeed in this role and progress to higher positions within the company.</p>

                        <p>Prior to accepting this role, I worked as a Chase Summer Associate in Dallas, Texas for my summer internship. I felt like I did well in this role but I declined my return offer so that I could pursue a corporate finance position with a company in southeastern Idaho. I plan to use my skills to help strengthen companies in Idaho that benefit my community and help provide quality products and services to people throughout the world.</p>
